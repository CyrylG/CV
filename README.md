- Collaborated effectively in team environments to deliver projects utilising agile methodologies that involved stand-ups, planning sessions, sprints, pair-programming and retrospectives to enhance teamwork and clear communication.

#### Civil Engineering at City, University of London (September 2018 - July 2022)

- My dissertation dealt with the internal stability of reinforcement cages under self-weight. Whilst working on this dissertation I learnt how to use new software to model reinforcement cages and had to effectively research a niche topic.

## Skills
#### Problem solving

I have always had a strong analytical mind set which I am constantly developing. From UKMT maths challenges during secondary school to a challenging engineering degree and finally to Makers Academy. At Makers Academy I focussed my problem solving skills on software developing which has quickly become my passion. At Makers Academy I enhanced my skills with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices, allowing me to dissect difficult challenges into smaller manageable steps.

#### Team Work and Communication

I have had a lot of experience working in a team. During my time at university I have had many team projects, including an intensive 2 week project where as a team we had to work together effectively to find a way to accommodate everyone's schedules and divide the workload. At Makers Academy I amplified these skills through agile methodologies, delivering products efficiently and effectively in team projects working both remotely and in person. 

#### Organization and attention to detail

During my time at university and working as a tutor I am used to working efficiently under time pressure. I have developed an understanding of the importance of being organized to ensure that I can look back at any work I have done and understand it without any trouble.

## Hobbies

I love to spend my time actively, I especially enjoy rock climbing as it combines physical exertion with problem solving, I also enjoy badminton and going to the gym. I also love to travel, I enjoy experiencing new cultures, new cuisines and exploring new places.
